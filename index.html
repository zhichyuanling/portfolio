  <!-- ABOUT / CAREER OBJECTIVE -->
  <section class="container section">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Game Developer with over 3 years of professional experience in the game development industry.
      I hold a Bachelor’s Degree (Hons) in Computer Game Development from Asia Pacific University (APU),
      completed in October 2022.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since graduating, I have been actively involved in commercial game development, working on
      blockchain-based NFT games, including card games and idle games. My contributions include
      core gameplay systems, game mechanics, and technical implementation, from early prototyping
      through to production. I have collaborated closely with designers and technical teams to deliver
      stable and engaging gameplay experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am passionate about building robust gameplay systems and continuously improving my technical
      skill set, with the long-term goal of becoming an expert game programmer. This portfolio showcases
      selected professional and academic projects that reflect my growth from an academic background
      into the professional game development industry.
